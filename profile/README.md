# Hi there! 👋  

I’m a passionate and experienced software developer with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems. Over the years, I’ve worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks, always striving to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving tech landscape.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, C#  
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, SASS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Django, Flask, Express, Spring Boot  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GitHub Actions, Terraform  
- **Tools**: Git, VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Postman, Jira  

## 🔭 Current Focus  

I’m currently diving deeper into **cloud-native development** and **microservices architecture**, exploring how to build resilient and scalable systems using modern DevOps practices. I’m also experimenting with **AI/ML integrations** to enhance application intelligence and user experience.  

## 🌱 Learning  

Always learning! Right now, I’m exploring **Rust** for systems programming and **GraphQL** for more efficient API design. I’m also brushing up on **data engineering** concepts to better understand data pipelines and ETL processes.  

## 💡 Approach to Development  

I believe in writing clean, readable, and well-documented code. I’m a strong advocate for **test-driven development (TDD)** and **continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)** practices. Collaboration and communication are key to my workflow, and I enjoy working in agile environments where feedback is valued.  

## 📌 Pinned Repositories  

Here are some of my favorite projects:  

- **[Project Alpha](https://github.com/sonnymurray3707/project-alpha)**: A scalable microservices architecture built with Go and Kubernetes.  
- **[React Dashboard](https://github.com/sonnymurray3707/react-dashboard)**: A modern admin dashboard built with React and Tailwind CSS.  
- **[AI Chatbot](https://github.com/sonnymurray3707/ai-chatbot)**: A conversational AI chatbot powered by Python and TensorFlow.
